REVIEW OF 1ST GEN:
NVIDIA has a brand new "World" model called Cosmos. Such models are a "real-world simulation which can predict outcomes".
These can be used for physics/vehicles/robotics, but also VIDEO gen (and vid2vid for that matter.)
Here is my first run with Cosmos. Even better, this was run on RunPod on a 4090.
It used about 21 GB of the 24 GB. Very impressive 121 frames compared to Mochi1 in 16 GB for example.
This is their "small" model. I will be running the bigger one when some larger GPUs become available.
(expect higher quality)  Right off the bat .. IMPRESSIVE!!  and RunPod is working beautifully.
I was a little trapped at 16 GB but now I can run on much more powerful GPUs .. and I was ready to do that.
I've sort of maxed out my workflows on the RTX A5000s and it's time to run on some cloud GPUs.
(Cosmos model size, small version is around 14 GB and the big one is around 29 GB.)
