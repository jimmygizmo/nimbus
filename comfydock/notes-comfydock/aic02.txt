Explanation:
Version: We are using version 3.8 of Docker Compose.
Services:
comfyui: This is the main ComfyUI service.
Build Context: This points to the current directory . and the Dockerfile within the project.
Ports: Exposes port 8188 on the host machine for the ComfyUI web interface.
Volumes: Mounts a local directory ./comfyui_data to the container's /opt/comfyui/data for persistent data.
Restart Policy: Ensures the container will restart automatically on failure.
Runtime: Specifies the use of NVIDIA runtime for GPU acceleration.
Network: Connects to the comfyui_network network for communication between services.
comfyui-manager: This service is for managing ComfyUI.
Depends on ComfyUI: It starts only after the comfyui service is up and running.
Ports: Exposes port 8189 on the host machine for the ComfyUI Manager web interface.
Other configurations are similar to comfyui.
Networks: We define a comfyui_network using the default bridge driver to allow the services to communicate.
Volumes: comfyui_data is a named volume to persist ComfyUI-related data.
Running the Services:
Place this docker-compose.yml file alongside your Dockerfile.
Run docker-compose up --build to build and start the containers.
Access the ComfyUI web interface at http://localhost:8188.
Access the ComfyUI Manager at http://localhost:8189.
This setup should provide you with a scalable and easily manageable environment for running ComfyUI with Docker Compose!
