
Running ComfyUI on RunPod - Storage Volume Deployment - Self-Install on top of a CUDA/PyTorch-ready Ubuntu Pod

Jupyter is your main (initial) interface into the Pod/VM/env.
Then, your app runs against a unique/session-only VM hostname on port 8188 for Comfy.
Simple. A great way to run things and maintain most of your setup along with your work on storage volumes.
Drawbacks? Storage volumes are liked to datacenters and GPU availability varies so you might find yourself creating
additional storage volumes in different datacenters and having to move your work around, which is not so bad.
I like the storage volume method and have now done plenty work with it, so next I move on to Serverless and
building and deploying container (Docker) images which is also a different but very very awesome deployment model.

His installer script for Comfy, Manager and his Node Pack.
(It works nicely .. but you have to convert all the CR/LF in it to just LF.
You'll know if you try to run it before that! It will give some ugly errors.
Convert it to all LF .. Unix/Linux text-file format.)

Actually this makes directories and installs everything. Verified: Comfy runs great.
