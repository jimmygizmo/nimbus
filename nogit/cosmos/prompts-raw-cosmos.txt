# Start with ChatGPT-recommended prompt. So the prompt to ChatGTP is:

the camera is low to the roadway and travelling fast down the center of the lane of the autobahn which is lined with majestic cypress tress which are moving by quickly. the camera moves down the left lane in the wrong direction towards the oncoming vehicles and a massive, modern 18 wheeler truck manufactured by Scania with its headlights on is approaching very rapidly. it looks like the truck is going to collide with us but it passes overhead at a blinding speed and as it passes over dust and gravel are blasted towards the camera from the wheels. as the truck passes over us the intricate and beautiful chrome undercarriage of this diesel behemoth is clearly visible and in crisp focus, as are the brand new tires rolling past us on either side. This is a long truck so it takes a moment to completely pass over us. It is like laying on train tracks and watching a train pass over you. It is like laying on a mechanics creeper and seeing the underside of a vehicle as you move under it. The entire scene is of the rapid head-on approach of the intimidating yet beautiful truck and then the teriifying close call of the truck passing over us, leaving a whirlwind of dust and gravel as the aftermath if such a dangerous close call on the highway. Trucks on modern highways may travel at 80 miles per hour or more and a near miss with them is a near miss with catastrophe. Luckily the drivers car in which the camera is located is a very low car and so we were able to pass under the truck.

TOO LONG - ERRORS

Create an expansive and immersive hyper-realistic video that looks like a painting inspired by the glossy, surreal aesthetic of Salvador Dali, with the bold, psychedelic detailing and vivid colors characteristic of Ed Roth’s artwork. The scene takes place in a large, lively dance party filled with people wearing a diverse range of futuristic costumes, inspired by the eclectic mix of creatures and outfits seen in the Jabba the Hutt bar scene from Return of the Jedi. The atmosphere is electric and vibrant, yet bizarre, set in a hyper-realistic dreamscape that feels alive and tangible. The dance party is taking place at night under neon lights, with dazzling reflections, glowing surfaces, and a surreal, glossy sheen that permeates every surface. The characters—college students from a large California university, possibly located in Isla Vista—are a mix of energetic and carefree individuals, their youthful faces gleaming with excitement and joy. Their outfits blend avant-garde fashion with futuristic technological elements, glowing accessories, and creative renditions of classic space-age attire, mingling with hints of retrofuturism.

The individuals’ movement is captured mid-dance, as if frozen in a moment of fluid motion, with a dreamlike quality to their bodies and faces—hyper-realistic but with the surreal fluidity of Dali’s fluid forms. Their faces express a range of emotions from joy and ecstasy to curiosity and eccentricity, creating an overall feeling of festive abandon and youthful exuberance. Some people are dancing alone, lost in the rhythm, while others form small groups, chatting or laughing, as they twirl and leap around the scene.

The background features a larger-than-life neon-lit club, adorned with whimsical, fantastical elements—swirling, abstract shapes that defy the laws of physics and space, along with other-worldly structures that blend both organic and mechanical designs. The walls reflect a warped and distorted reality, shimmering like liquid chrome, as if the entire room is a fluid entity of its own, bending and warping in surreal ways like a Dali clock. Above them, shimmering lights twirl and spiral, reminiscent of a modernist interpretation of surreal cosmic phenomena.

There are soft, glowing hues—vivid purples, electric blues, and bright neon greens—contrasting with chrome and metallic surfaces, creating an otherworldly glow that’s distinctly retrofuturistic. It’s as if the scene has been filtered through a lens that turns everything into a living, breathing painting, with brushstrokes and textures reminiscent of Dali's surreal worlds. Every moment is captured as if it’s alive and dancing within the painting itself, with light bouncing off glossy surfaces, creating complex reflections and intricate details.

The filter adds an extra layer to the visual experience, giving the scene a textured, glossy finish like an oil painting, making the video footage appear as if it were a piece of hyper-realistic art come to life, where every detail, every movement feels alive yet suspended in a surreal dream. The faces of the students are highly detailed and expressive, their clothing intricately designed with a range of textures—some futuristic and metallic, others organic and whimsical, blending the styles of science fiction and high fashion. The whole atmosphere of the dance party exudes the warmth of a sun-loving college town, with the revelers embodying the carefree, spirited nature of Isla Vista.

Incorporate elements of exaggerated proportions, strange perspective, and warped reality, creating a fluid sense of movement and surrealism, with flashes of bright, neon colors that blend into deep shadows, adding a touch of mystery and intrigue to the scene. The final image should evoke a sense of wonder, with an almost hyperrealistic quality—like the painting has come alive, yet still retains its otherworldly, painted essence.

LION

A majestic lion is sitting in the golden gently swaying grass with his lion's golden mane gently blowing in the wind and the golden-red shine of the setting sun illuminating the lions luxurious fur. the glint and sparkle of the golden-red setting sun is shining in the lions eyes and reflecting off his large fangs as he sits in the grass and pants, resting during the sunset, presumably after a kill. The lion pants for a moment, exposing his tremendous teeth, but then licks his lips and closes his mouth reminding me of how my cat eats his dinner, except this is on huge kitty cat. His image resting in the sunset is a masterpiece of video footage. The clip is hyper-realistic, high-definition, high-resolution and colorful because of the golden red orange and purple colors of the sunset illuminating the scene.

* partially good result. all good except lower jaw so will simplify mouth movements in prompt.
